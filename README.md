# CustomPopup

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
My implementation for a Popup View, which Apple uses across the iOS system.
</br>
</br>
I use it in my pet projects to display information to user. It has a scrollable text if information longer that Popup width and option to change it's data while displaying.
