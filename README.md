# CustomPopup 

My implementation for a Popup View, which Apple uses across the iOS.

I use it in my pet projects to display information to user. It has a scrollable text if information longer that Popup width and option to change it's data while displaying.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

-   **UIKit**;
-   **Storyboard and Xib** for UI
